    "&ensp; COVID influences us so much and changes our life especially our travel. People need to stay home to avoid COVID. There are also a lot of “ban laws” that limit flight and restrict people at home. So their must be some consequence to people's life. For this project I want to instavage how COVID influences our travel. So the research questions are **does COVID influence affect people's mobility, if so how badly it affect us COVID. Also which city being influence the most by COVID**. My hypothesis is their will be at lease 50% decrease in flight because of the COVID. I think it should be a quantitative study but also involve human data because we need to check different factors that influence people’s travel. <BR>\n",
    "&ensp; In China, their are really strong \n",
    "&ensp; The dataset I’m trying to use is from  [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=GED&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45). It contains flight’s information such as carrier, delay, cancellation, origin city, depeature city, etc. The data collected by authority, so it should be tusty. My colleagues suggested that I check the cancellation and what caused the flight to be canceled. But when I look up the data, there is a dataset containing that information but each dataset is separate by month and each file has over 500000 rows. So it will be a challenge and wastes time to collect those data and analyze them myself. [Here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/homepage.asp) are some visualizations that the bureau already makes, so I’m planning to use those. \n"
