#### How to run the project
- Download all the files in this repo and run `final_project.ipynb` step by step.
- First need to install geopandas, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot library in local. Or run the project on https://jupyter.rttl.uw.edu/2022-spring-hcde-410-a/user/lxzhe718/lab/tree/HCDE410SP22/final_project/final_project.ipynb(only for UW)
- All the file are write in relevant path. If some parts do not work, replace them with an absolute path.


#### Dataset
- The 4 main datasets I use for analysis are `flight_2018.csv`, `flight_2019.csv`, `flight_2020.csv`, `flight_2021.csv`. They are all coming from [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=GED&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45). [Here](https://www.bts.gov/learn-about-bts-and-our-work/about-bts/legislative-mandates) are their legislative mandates which state how they can collect data and there is **no copyright restrictions** on Department of Transportation (DOT) publications data. More details can be found [here](https://transportation.libanswers.com/faq/156950)
- Secondary data, in the folder `map`, I use contains U.S map information. The dataset comes from [National  Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/gis/USStates). The copyright is AMS Copyright.
