- COVID influences us so much and changes our life especially our travel. People need to stay home to avoid COVID. There are also a lot of “ban laws” that limit flight and restrict people at home. There must be some consequences to people's lives. So I’m planning to instvage the travel situation in U.S by looking at 3 data provided by [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=GED&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45) and analysis in python.
